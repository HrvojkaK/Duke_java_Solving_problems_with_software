Export reads a csv file containing data about different countries, their exports and the total value of the country exports in USD (when run, Export will ask for the file; there are 2 in the folder: exportdata.csv and export_small.csv).

Prints out the countries exporting 2 selected goods (given in test method), and countries with total export value of $1,000,000,000 and above. 


Export uses edu.duke and org.apache.commons.csv. library - they comes with Duke Uni's edition of BlueJ environment, downloadable from
